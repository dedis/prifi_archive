|      IMPLIMENTED SHUFFLES         |
=====================================

This folder defines a number of approaches to cryptographic shuffles, either to
be used during the initialization phase of Dissent-style protocols or as an
indepdendant communication mechanism. 


NEFF SHUFFLES
=============

The files neff.go and subset.go impliment iterated Neff shuffles (similar to
the one used in the initialization phase of Dissent v2). Clients onion encrypt
their plaintext messages as El Gamal pairs. All clients send their pairs to a
designated starting node. Each node in sequence performs a Neff shuffle and
strips away a layer of encryption on all pairs, distributing the shuffle proof
to all other nodes.  If any node finds a discrepency in the proof, it forwards
the proof to all clients, warning them of the shuffle's failure. In neff.go,
all nodes are used in the shuffle, which in subset.go, a random subset is
picked, based on a collectively established key; collective uniform random is a
separate problem we ignore for the time being.


BUTTERFLY SHUFFLE
=================

The file butterfly.go implements a butterfly network of Neff-shuffle subgroups.
Subgroups are established randomly, based on a unform, shared, collectively
generated seed. Clients are assigned initial shuffle groups. Each client onion
encrypts its plaintext for the initial shuffle group it is assigned. Once the
subgroup's Neff shuffle has completed, the last node in the shuffle subgroup
divides the shuffled messages in two equal parts, giving one half two each
child subgroup in the butterfly network. These messages are onion encrypted for
the next subgroup before they are sent. 


CONFLICT SHUFFLE
================

The file conflict.go implements a special form of the Butterfly shuffle. It is
designed for sitautions in which a large number of client messages are the
identity element, as would be the case in group messaging applications. Once
the last node in a shuffler subgroup has performed its Neff shuffle, it divides
the shuffled pairs in two lists, like in the normal Butterfly shuffle.  But
rather than giving one list of pairs to each child, it gives each list to a
random child determined by a coin flip.  If both list of pairs are assigned to
the same child, the lists elements are added together (assuming an additive
group). Although this may result in corrupted messages, it allows for much more
thorough mixing than would be possible with conventional the Butterfly shuffle.

| PROTOCOLS AND COMMUNICATION METHODS |
=======================================


CONFIG FILES
============

All testing commands require a JSON configuration file with the following fields:
	NumNodes     int
	NumClients   int
	NumRounds    int
  ResendTime   seconds
  MsgsPerGroup int

In Butterfly and Conflict shuffles, NumRounds refers to the total number of
Neff shuffle steps performed by all shuffle groups, plus the number of
transfers between shuffle groups. MsgsPerGroup refers to the number of client
pairs shuffled by each shuffle-group. 


CHANNEL SHUFFLE
===============

The files in the gochan subdirectory allow the shuffle techniques above to be
run on a single machine, using Go's lightweight channels. Tests may be invoked
by running gochan [configFile]. To run the tests on multiple OS threads, set the
GOMAXPROCS environment varaible to the number of OS threads you want to use.


NETWORK SHUFFLE
===============

The files in the netchan subdirectory allow the shuffle techniques above to be
run on a networked cluster of machines. On the client side, tets may be invoked
by running client [configFile] [nodeURIs] [nodePubKeys], where nodeURIs is a
newline separated file of nodes participating in the shuffle, and nodePubKeys
is a newline separated file containing their public keys. On the server side,
tests may be invoked by running server [configFile] [nodeURIs] [clientURIs]
[privKey], where clientURIs is a newline separated file containing the URIs of
each client participating in the shuffle, and privKey is a file containing that
node's private key. To simplify the deployment of client and server tests, the
script netTest.sh is provided. Invoke it as netTest.sh [configFile] [nodeURIs].


PROTOCOL
========

The network shuffle works over TCP. All nodes can send one of two message types:

- PAIR MESSAGE:
send a 0 (the pair message indicator- 1 byte)
send the round int (4 bytes, big endian)
wait for a 1 byte from the sender
send the number of pairs (4 bytes, big endian)
send all the Xs
send all the Ys
send H

- PROOF MESSAGE
send a 1 (the proof message indicator- 1 byte)
send the proof itself
send the number of pairs
send the Xs
send the Ys
send the old Xs
send the old Ys
send H
